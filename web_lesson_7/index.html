        <h2>Here are some of the most common tech addictions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Net Compulsions</b> - Net compulsions concern interactive activities online that can be extremely harmful,
                 such as online gambling, trading stocks, online auctions (such as eBay), and compulsive online shopping.
                  These habits can have a detrimental impact on one’s financial stability and disrupt job-related duties.
                   Spending or losing excessive amounts of money can also cause stress in one’s relationships. 
                   With instant and easy access to online casinos and stores, it is easy for those who are already susceptible to a gambling or spending addiction to get hooked.<br>
                    <br>
                   <b>Cyber (Online) Relationship Addiction</b> - Cyber or online relationship addicts are deeply involved with finding and maintaining relationships online,
                    often forgetting and neglecting real-life family and friends. 
                    Typically online relationships are formed in chat rooms or different social networking sites but can occur anywhere one can interact with people online.
                     Often people who pursue online relationships do so while concealing their real identity and appearance; this modern phenomena led to the creation of the term “catfish.”
                   After being consumed by an online social life and persona, a person may be left with limited social skills and unrealistic expectations concerning in-person interactions.
                    Many times this leads to an inability to make real-world connections, in turn making the individual more dependent on their cyber relationships.
                     Counseling or therapy is typically required to treat this addiction and ensure lasting behavioral changes.
